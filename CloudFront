CloudFront

What is Amazon CloudFront?
Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service provided by AWS that accelerates content delivery by distributing it across a network of edge locations.

How does CloudFront work?
CloudFront caches content in edge locations globally. When a user requests content, CloudFront delivers it from the nearest edge location, reducing latency and improving performance.

What are edge locations in CloudFront?
Edge locations are data centers globally distributed by CloudFront. They store cached content and serve it to users, minimizing the distance data needs to travel.

What are the benefits of using CloudFront with Amazon S3?
Using CloudFront with Amazon S3 reduces latency, offloads traffic from your origin server, and improves global content delivery.
