EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

What is EC2
EC2 is Elastic Compute Cloud thats provides secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allos user to create, configure and manage virtual servers in the AWS cloud.

What are different types of Instance types?
There are 5 types of instance storage, General Purpose, Memory Optimized, Compute Optimized, Storage Optimized and Accelerated Computing.

What is General Purpose?
General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of applications, including web servers, development and test environments.

What is Memory Optimized?
Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads. They are suitable for applications that require large amounts of memory.

What is Compute optimized?
Compute Optimized instances provide a higher ratio of compute power to memory.

What is Storage optimized?
Storage Optimized instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets.

Explain the differences between on-demand, reserved, and spot instances.
On-Demand Instances: Pay-as-you-go pricing with no upfront commitment.
Reserved Instances: Provides capacity reservation at a lower cost in exchange for a commitment.
Spot Instances: Allows users to bid on unused EC2 capacity, potentially leading to significantly lower costs.
